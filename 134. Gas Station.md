# 134. Gas Station

## Example 1:

    Input:
    gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
    cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

    Output: 3

    Explanation:
    Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
    Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
    Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
    Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

## Example 2:

    Input:
    gas  = [2,3,4]
    cost = [3,4,3]

    Output: -1

    Explanation:
    You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
    Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
    You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
    Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} gas
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var canCompleteCircuit = function (gas, cost) {
  let start = 0;
  let total = 0;
  let tank = 0;
  //if car fails at 'start', record the next station
  for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
    if ((tank = tank + gas[i] - cost[i]) < 0) {
      start = i + 1;
      total += tank;
      tank = 0;
    }
  }
  return total + tank < 0 ? -1 : start;
};
```
