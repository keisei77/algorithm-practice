# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_1_1.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

## Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_2.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

## Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
    Output: null
    Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
    Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} headA
 * @param {ListNode} headB
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var getIntersectionNode = function (headA, headB) {
  if (!headA || !headB) {
    return null;
  }
  let curA = headA;
  let curB = headB;
  while (curA != curB) {
    curA = curA == null ? headB : curA.next;
    curB = curB == null ? headA : curB.next;
  }
  return curA;
};
```
