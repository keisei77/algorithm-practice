# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

## Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)

    Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
    Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
    Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.

## Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)

    Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
    Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
    Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
