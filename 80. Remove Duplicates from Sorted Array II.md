# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
    Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
    Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
    Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
    Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function (nums) {
  let i = 0;
  for (let n of nums) {
    if (i < 2 || n > nums[i - 2]) {
      nums[i++] = n;
    }
  }
  return i;
};
```
