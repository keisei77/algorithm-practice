# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

## Example 3:

    Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function (nums) {
  let l = 0;
  let r = nums.length - 1;
  while (l < r) {
    const m = Math.floor((l + r) / 2);
    if (nums[m] > nums[r]) l = m + 1;
    else r = m;
  }
  return nums[l];
};
```
