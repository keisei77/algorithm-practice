# 133. Clone Graph

## Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

    Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
    1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
    3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

## Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

    Input: adjList = [[]]
    Output: [[]]
    Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

## Example 3:

    Input: adjList = []
    Output: []
    Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

## Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

    Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
    Output: [[2],[1]]

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * // Definition for a Node.
 * function Node(val, neighbors) {
 *    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
 *    this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {Node} node
 * @return {Node}
 */
var cloneGraph = function (node) {
  if (node === null) {
    return null;
  }
  const map = new Map();
  const clone = (root) => {
    if (!map.has(root.val)) {
      map.set(root.val, new Node(root.val));
      map.get(root.val).neighbors = root.neighbors.map(clone);
    }
    return map.get(root.val);
  };
  return clone(node);
};
```
