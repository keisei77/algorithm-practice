# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

## Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let minimumPrice = Number.MAX_VALUE;
  let maximumProfit = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    minimumPrice = Math.min(minimumPrice, prices[i]);
    maximumProfit = Math.max(maximumProfit, prices[i] - minimumPrice);
  }

  return maximumProfit;
};
```
