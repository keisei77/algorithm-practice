# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 7

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

## Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 4

Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

## Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 \* 10 ^ 4

0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4

## Solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let profit = 0,
    buyDay = 0,
    sellDay = 0,
    days = prices.length;
  while (buyDay < days && sellDay < days) {
    while (buyDay < days - 1 && prices[buyDay + 1] < prices[buyDay]) {
      buyDay++;
    }
    sellDay = buyDay;
    while (sellDay < days - 1 && prices[sellDay + 1] > prices[sellDay]) {
      sellDay++;
    }
    profit += prices[sellDay] - prices[buyDay];
    buyDay = sellDay + 1;
  }

  return profit;
};
```
